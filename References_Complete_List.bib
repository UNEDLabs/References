  Abstract                 = {Student-teacher and student-student interactions in purely asynchronous distance learning courses are much lacking compared to similar interactions found in face-to-face teaching, causing learners to experience feelings of isolation, thus reducing motivation and increasing dropout rates. We used PalTalk, an Internet text and audio chat client from AVM Software, Inc. (New York, NY), to offer our students live virtual classroom sessions within a unit of our online distance learning M.Sc. program in Healthcare Informatics. On-demand replays of audio excerpts from the sessions were also provided to accommodate absenteeism and for student review. Five students completed an evaluation questionnaire. Our results highlighted the potential merits of using synchronous conferencing to assist in fostering a sense of belonging to one supportive learning community among distance learners and improve educational outcomes. Students were very positive toward the real-time human interaction and voted for a 95/5 (asynchronous/synchronous percentages) blended delivery approach for a typical unit in our program. They also praised PalTalk's voice quality and ease of use. This paper presents educational and technological perspectives about this experiment in the form of a state-ofthe- art review, without intending to be statistically rigorous. However, robust research evidence is still required to convince educators fully about the benefits of synchronous communication tools and help them decide on the most suitable solutions for their particular circumstances.}

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) emphasize authentic scientific practices such as developing models and constructing explanations of phenomena. However, research documents how students struggle to explain observable phenomena with molecular-level behaviors with current classroom experiences. For example, physical laboratory experiences in science enable students to interact with observable scientific phenomena, but students often fail to make connections to underlying molecular-level behaviors. Virtual laboratory experiences and computer-based visualizations enable students to interact with unobservable scientific concepts, but students can have difficulties connecting to actual instantiations of the observed phenomenon. This paper investigates how combining physical and virtual experiences into augmented virtual science laboratories can help students build upon intuitive ideas and develop molecular-level explanations of macroscopic phenomena. Specifically, this study uses the Frame, a sensor-augmented virtual lab that uses sensors as physical inputs to control scientific simulations. Eighth-grade students (N = 45) engaged in a Frame lab focused on the properties of gas. Results demonstrate that students using the Frame lab made progress developing molecular-level explanations of gas behavior and refining alternative and partial ideas into normative ideas about gases. This study offers insights for how augmented virtual labs can be designed to enhance science learning and encourage scientific practices as called for in the NGSS. },

  Abstract                 = {The two separate projects described have examined how teachers exploit computer-based technologies in supporting learning of science at secondary level. This paper examines how pedagogical approaches associated with these technological tools are adapted to both the cognitive and structuring resources available in the classroom setting. Four teachers participated in the first study, undertaken as part of the InterActive Education project in Bristol; all of them used multimedia simulations in their lessons. The second study presented was part of the wider SET-IT project in Cambridge; 11 teachers in eight schools were observed using multimedia simulations, data logging tools and interactive whiteboards. Teachers were interviewed in all cases to elicit their pedagogical thinking about their classroom use of ICT. The findings suggest that teachers are moving away from only using �real� experiments in their practice. They are exploring the use of technologies to encourage students to engage in �What If� explorations where the outcomes of �virtual� experiments can be immediately accessed, for example through using a simulation. However, this type of activity can serve just as a mechanism for revealing � and indeed reinforcing � students� informal conceptions if cognitive conflict is not generated or remains unresolved. The teachers in our studies used simulations, data logging, projected animations and other dynamic digital resources as tools to encourage and support prediction and to demonstrate scientific concepts and physical processes � thereby �bridging the gap� between scientific and informal knowledge. They also integrated technology carefully with other practical activities so as to support stepwise knowledge building, consolidation and application. Research of this kind has design implications for both curriculum-related activities and emerging computer-based learning technologies, in terms of helping us to understand how teachers capitalise upon the technology available in supporting students to construct links between scientific theory and empirical evidence. },

  Abstract                 = {The Go-Lab federation of online labs opens up virtual laboratories (simulation), remote laboratories (real equipment accessible at distance) and data sets from physical laboratory experiments (together called ``online labs'') for large-scale use in education. In this way, Go-Lab enables inquiry-based learning that promotes acquisition of deep conceptual domain knowledge and inquiry skills, with the further intent of interesting students in careers in science. For students, Go-Lab offers the opportunity to perform scientific experiments with online labs in pedagogically structured learning spaces. Go-Lab's inquiry learning spaces (ILSs) structure the students' inquiry process through an inquiry cycle and provide students with guidance in which dedicated (and connected) scaffolds for inquiry processes play a pivotal role. Teachers can create and adapt inquiry learning phases and the associated guidance in an ILS through a simple wiki-like interface and can add scaffolds and tools to an ILS using a straightforward drag and drop feature. Teachers can also adapt scaffolds and tools (e.g., change the language or the concepts available in a concept mapper) through an ``app composer''. In creating ILSs, teachers are supported by scenarios and associated defaults ILSs that can be used as a starting point for development. In addition, teachers are offered a community framework to disseminate best practices and find mutual support. For lab-owners, Go-Lab provides open interfacing solutions for easily plugging in their online labs and sharing them in the Go-Lab federation of online labs. In its first year, Go-Lab created ILSs for thirteen online labs from different lab providers, including renowned research organizations (e.g., CERN, ESA) that participate in the consortium. The design of these inquiry learning spaces has been evaluated through mock-ups and prototypes with students and teachers. More advanced and later versions will be evaluated and validated in large scale pilots. The sustainability of Go-Lab will come from the opportunity for the larger science education community to add new online labs and share ILSs. An open and Web-based community will capitalize on the ``collective intelligence'' of students, teachers, and scientists.},

  Abstract                 = {{Despite obvious domination of asynchronous collaborative technologies, especially for virtual classrooms and distance education, the work presented in this paper is based on the assumption that some students will still prefer the experience of on-campus, faceto- face collaborative learning. For those students a new synchronous collaborative environment is created by combining an innovative methodology for 'same-time, same-place' interactive learning and the technology called Group Support Systems which is designed to provide not only communication but rather computer-mediated collaboration. This paper introduces this learning methodology and illustrates its potential to improve critical thinking, problem solving and communication skills of all students who are stimulated to participate as equal learners. It also describes how teachers are transformed from 'information delivery specialists' to guides and facilitators of learning.}},

  Abstract                 = {Economic pressures on universities and the emergence of new technologies have spurred the creation of new systems for delivering engineering laboratories in education, in particular simulations and remote-access laboratory systems. Advocates of simulation argue that physical labs needlessly consume university space and students� time. However, proponents of hands-on laboratories argue that student engineers should be exposed to real environments. Remote laboratories have appeared as a third option. These laboratories are similar to simulation techniques in that they require minimal space and time, because the experiments can be rapidly configured and run over the Internet. But unlike simulations, they provide real data. Studying the relative effectiveness of these modes of delivering student laboratories is complex, for the underlying technology of the laboratory is just one of many possible factors that could influence effectiveness. For example, the interface to the equipment may be of importance, as might the discussions students have among themselves. This paper presents a model for testing the relative effectiveness of engineering laboratories in education that takes account of these and other factors. The results are presented for an assessment study comparing versions of remote labs versus hands-on labs in a junior-level mechanical engineering course on machine dynamics and mechanisms. The results suggest that students learned lab content information equally well from both types of laboratories, and that they have a realistic understanding and appreciation of the practical advantages of remote laboratories. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Educational remote laboratories are software and hardware tools that allow students to remotely access real equipment located in the university as if they were in a hands-on-lab session. Different initiatives have existed during the last two decades, and indeed toolkits (e.g. iLabs, WebLab-Deusto or Labshare Sahara) have been developed to ease their development by providing common management features (e.g. authentication or scheduling). Each of these systems was developed aiming particular constraints, so it could be difficult to migrate the labs built on top of one system to other. While there is certainly some overlap among these systems, with bridges among them they become complimentary. Given that these systems support web services based federation protocols for sharing labs, it is possible to achieve this goal, and share labs among different universities through different systems. The impact of this goal is that different institutions can increase the experiential activities of their students, potentially improving their learning goals. The focus is the integration of WebLab-Deusto labs inside the iLab Shared Architecture, as well as the integration of iLab batch labs inside WebLab-Deusto, detailing limitations and advantages of both integrations and showing particular cases. },

  Abstract                 = {Science and engineering students� involvement in practical work contributes to the development of their understanding of the concepts and processes of science. The Practical Experimentation by Accessible Remote Learning (PEARL) project aimed to develop a system to enable students to conduct real-world experiments at a distance using a computer. We explored methods of extending the flexibility of laboratory teaching in terms of time and location, and of meeting the requirements of students with special needs. This involved the development of remote experiments at four Universities. This paper uses one of the four experiments, spectroscopy for introductory science in a distance learning setting, to illustrate the process of developing remote experiments. We describe the evaluation work leading to refinement of the design, and an assessment of the learning experience for students. This paper presents the findings of the validation phases of the project which have established the feasibility of the remote experiment approach.},

  Abstract                 = {This mixed-methods investigation compared the effectiveness of three instructional approaches in achieving desired conceptual change among early childhood preservice teachers (n = 157). Each of the three treatments employed inquiry-based instruction on moon phases using data collected from: (1) the planetarium software program, Starry Night�, (2) nature observations and Starry Night�, or (3) nature observations alone. Data sources included drawings, intensive interviews, and a lunar shapes card sort. The data sets were analyzed via a constant comparative method in order to produce profiles of each participant�s pre- and post-instruction conceptual understandings of moon phases. Non-parametric tests of significance revealed that pre- to post-instruction gains were significant for all three treatments across all targeted concepts. The Starry Night�-Only treatment demonstrated statistically greater gains for sequencing moon phases than the other two treatments. However, there were no significant differences among the three treatments in regard to participants� abilities to draw scientific moon shapes or in their conceptions of the causes of moon phases. Thus, the three treatments were equally effective in facilitating desired conceptual change.},

  abstractnote = {&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of traditional face to face labs versus non-traditional online, remote, or distance labs is difficult to assess due to the lack of continuity in the literature between terminology, standard evaluation metrics, and the use of a wide variety non-traditional laboratory experience for online courses. This narrative review presents a representative view of the existing literature in order to identify the strengths and weaknesses of non-traditional laboratories and to highlight the areas of opportunity for research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Non-traditional labs are increasingly utilized in higher education. The research indicates that these non-traditional approaches to a science laboratory experience are as effective at achieving the learning outcomes as traditional labs. While this is an important parameter, this review outlines further important considerations such as operating and maintenance cost, growth potential, and safety. This comparison identifies several weaknesses in the existing literature. While it is clear that traditional labs aid in the development of practical and procedural skills, there is a lack of research exploring if non-traditional laboratory experiments hinder student success in subsequent traditional labs. Additionally, remote lab kits blur the lines between modality by bringing experiences that are more tactile to students outside of the traditional laboratory environment. Though novel work on non-traditional labs continues to be published, investigations are still needed regarding cost differences, acquisition of procedural skills, preparation for advanced work, and instructor contact time between traditional and non-traditional laboratories.&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

  abstract    = {Recent advances in remote sensing and actuation  technologies, coupled with the large reach of the internet,  allowed for the emergence of applications such as  cyber-physical labs. Cyber-physical labs are the digital  and remotely-accessible equivalent of the lab equipment  students use in school to experiment, through web-based  interfaces such as web applications. Students, teachers and  lab owners derive value from these systems, they are our  stakeholders. Students are the intended users, teachers are  the educational content curators and lab owners are the  service providers.
In this thesis, we take a close look at  issues pertaining to cyber-physical labs and propose new  approaches to address them. We also analyze the use of such  systems in a MOOC, to detect the impact of the exherted  experimental behavior of students on their academic  performance.
First, we tackle the case of the generation of  web apps interfacing cyber-physical labs. It is the  equivalent of preparing experiments for teachers by  arranging the equipment for multiple experiments with the  same equipment. We propose an extension to the Smart Device  Specification for cyber-phyiscal labs, and a tool which  generates these apps based on it. The automatically  generated apps implement the necessary functions to use a  cyber-physical lab, and are ready to be integrated in  online learning platfroms.
Next, we investigate issues  related to the collection and retrieval of students'  generated data through their interaction with  cyber-physical labs. We consider the needs of students and  lab owners. Through questionnaires sent to both parties, we  elicit the requirements for an activity-tracking  infrastructure composed of a vocabulary and an  architectural model. The proposed vocabulary ensures  deriving value from the recorded activity, and the proposed  architecture addresses privacy and data access issues  pertaining to students and lab owners respectively. We  evaluate our proposal with two example cyber-physical  labs.
Last, we collect the interaction data with a  cyber-physical lab used in a MOOC. We devise computational  analyses on the students activity statistics, in search for  indicators of academic performance. We find that high and  low performing students show statistically different  activity statistics. Then, we sequence the steps students  did in an experiment, and don't find any statistically  significant patterns for low and high-performing students.  This analysis provides insights on the usage of installed  facilities to service a potential massive access to limited  resources (lab installations), and shed light on possible  indicators for academic performance.},

  abstract = {Server-Sent Events (or SSEs) is a standard HTTP technology used in many web applications nowadays. This protocol enables communication between a server and a client based on messages that are sent at the servers will. Different type of event triggers can be defined in the server and the client can subscribe to one or more of these event streams. Event-based control tries to optimize the communications between the plant and the controller while still performing an adequate control of the system. This is especially useful in networked control systems, where the plant and the controller are physically separated, and a network communication system is in between of them. Just like event-based control is a natural fit for networked control systems, this paper proposes the use of SSEs as a natural solution to implement event-based control strategies assigning the role of server to the plant and the role of client to the controller. The work presents the main advantages of using SSEs in this scenario, compares this technology to other possible solutions (such as WebSockets) and presents a communication workflow between client (controller) and server (plant) to define event triggers and subscribe to event streams that might be of interest to the controller.},
